        ## INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Analyze the conversation and extract commands based on the instructions that users are using in their conversations. Do NOT infer or guess intent, they should be explicit. If they are not explicitly saying the commands for the task operations, don't try to infer tasks.
        - Do NOT create an issue, comment, etc. if the user is just mentioning it passively. They should be explicit on their intention and you should be able to tell the difference.
        - When referring to an issue in the transcript, always match issue titles to the existing workspace state. If multiple titles are similar, choose the closest match using fuzzy logic. Never invent or generalize issue titles.
        - For relative dates, calculate based on today's date that was attached to the prompt.
        - Match names from the provided list of users. Do NOT invent names. If you get a nickname or a similar name, look in the user list and assign the closest one, but if it has nothing to do with any names, don't invent or send one that doesn't exist.
        - When trying to extract operations where you will add text, like title, description or comments, extract only the final decision, not the full discussion. If the transcript contains exploratory conversation, include only the clear final summary, decision, or definition of done.
        - If the user says "create issue X and assign to Y", create both `create` and `assign` operations.
        - If the user says "create issue X with label Y", and the label Y doesn't exist, first create a `create_label` operation for label Y, then create a `create` operation with the label. Only create labels when you're sure they don't exist.
        - If the user says "remove assignee from issue X", create a `remove_assignee` operation.
        - If the user says "remove label Y from issue X", create a `remove_label` operation.
        - If the user says "add label Y to issue X", first create a `create_label` operation for label Y if it doesn't exist, then create an `update` operation with labels field.
        - If the user says "create a new label Y", create a `create_label` operation.
        - If the user says "create sub-issue Y under issue X", create a `create_sub_issue` operation.
        - If the user says "update sub-issue Y", create an `update_sub_issue` operation.
        - If the user says "delete sub-issue Y", create a `delete_sub_issue` operation.
        - If the user says "remove assignee from sub-issue Y", create a `remove_assignee_sub_issue` operation.
        - If the user says "remove label Z from sub-issue Y", create a `remove_label_sub_issue` operation.
        - If the user says "change the assignee from issue X to Y", create an `assign` operation for user Y.
        - If the user says "add a comment to issue X", look for the issue in the workspace state and create a `comment` operation.
        - If we have renamed the issue in the transcript instruction, prepare the JSON response with the current name in the update action first, and then with the new name in the subsequent actions after the rename (for example, if the user says "rename issue X to Y and assign to Z", you should send the JSON with the update action with name X and the action for the assigning a user with the name Y).
        - If the user says "add a new issue called X and assign it to Y with high priority", create a new issue with the name X, assign to Y, and set priority to 2.
        - When no status is specified for a new issue, default to "Todo" (the first available state).
        - Check the existing issues in the workspace state to avoid creating duplicates. Do the same for comments within the issues.
        - If a comment already exists on an issue, if the text is similar, do NOT create another comment operation for the similar text.
        - When the user is talking about moving issues into a status or state, find the closest match in the available states and create an update operation for the issue with the new status.
        - When creating an issue, or updating it, if the user talks about putting it in a status or state, find the closest match in the available states and create a create or update operation for the issue with the new status.
        - If the user says "give me an issue for that", or something similar at the end of the sentence, create a new issue with the summary of what they just said.
        - If the user mentions something like they need someone to do a task in the list of issues or the issue being created, and that person is in the list of users, assign the issue to that person.
        - If the user mentions a person in their issue creation, and that person is not in the list of users, include their name in the issue title.
        - When the user is deleting something, make sure to delete only the thing they want to delete. Don't delete other things that were not explicitly mentioned to be deleted. (For example: "Delete the due date from Issue X and add a comment to Issue Y", just delete the due date of Issue X, don't delete Issue X or Issue Y)
        - For priority mapping, use INTEGER values:
          * "urgent", "critical", "p0" ‚Üí 1
          * "high", "important", "p1" ‚Üí 2
          * "medium", "normal", "p2" ‚Üí 3
          * "low", "minor", "p3" ‚Üí 4
          * "no priority", "none" ‚Üí 0
        - For status mapping, use common variations:
          * "Todo", "To Do", "Backlog", "Open" ‚Üí "Todo"
          * "In Progress", "Doing", "Working", "Active" ‚Üí "In Progress" 
          * "Done", "Completed", "Finished", "Closed" ‚Üí "Done"
          * "Review", "In Review", "Testing", "QA" ‚Üí Use exact status from workspace
        - For assignee: use empty string "" if no assignee is specified
        - If there is no due date or deadline assigned from the user, don't generate that field in the JSON
        - When creating issues with labels, use exact label names from the workspace. If a label doesn't exist, create it first using the `create_label` operation, then create the issue with the label.
        - When adding labels to existing issues, if a label doesn't exist, create it first using the `create_label` operation, then assign it to the issue.
        - For team-specific operations, use the first available team if no team is specified.
        - When updating issues, only include fields that are actually being changed. Don't include unchanged fields.

        ## SEQUENCE AWARENESS:
        - If the user mentions renaming an issue, process the rename first, then use the new name for subsequent operations
        - If the user mentions creating an issue and immediately assigning it, create the issue first, then assign
        - If the user mentions creating an issue and immediately commenting on it, create the issue first, then add the comment
        - If the user mentions adding a label that doesn't exist, create the label first, then assign it to the issue
        - When processing multiple operations, maintain logical order: create ‚Üí update ‚Üí assign ‚Üí comment

        ## CONTEXT HANDLING:
        - Use the workspace state to validate all references (users, labels, statuses)
        - Match issue titles using fuzzy matching when exact matches aren't found
        - Validate user names against the available users list
        - Validate status names against the available team states
        - Validate label names against the available labels list

        ## FORMAT RULES:
        - Output only a valid JSON object with key `issues`.
        - The `issues` array can be empty if no action is detected.
        - Do NOT include any explanatory text or markdown.
        - Use exact field names as specified in the operation types.
        - Ensure all required fields are present for each operation type.
